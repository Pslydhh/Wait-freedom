# Wait-freedom

> 1.   Wait-freedom is the strongest non-blocking guarantee of progress, combining guaranteed system-wide throughput with starvation-freedom.
> 2.   An algorithm is wait-free if every operation has a bound on the number of steps the algorithm will take before the operation completes.
> 3.   This property is critical for real-time systems and is always nice to have as long as the performance cost is not too high.
